# Development prompts and AI interaction summary

- Project: Incident Desk (CS3227-2610-MP2)
- Prepared: 2026-09-29, Asia/Singapore (UTC+08:00)
- User attribution: `lqr1019_prompt_log` (supplied by the user for conversation logging)
- Coverage: 114 historical turns across four available project tasks, plus this logging request.
- Repository reference: `a71e488`

## Scope and evidence

This document summarizes every retrieved turn from the four project-specific Codex tasks listed below, including follow-up instructions, corrections, approvals, commits and issue-completion requests. The user requested summaries, so prompts are paraphrased instead of reproduced verbatim. Each entry pairs the prompt with the recorded agent outcome. Multiple user messages within a turn are summarized together. Entries without a final response are explicitly marked.

All pages of these four tasks were retrieved. The accessible archived-task list contained no additional tasks for this repository. This is **not a verified complete record of every teammate’s AI use**: conversations on other accounts, devices, tools, deleted tasks, and unavailable attachment contents are not covered. Reporter and administrator implementation conversations are largely unavailable here. Git history provides additional development evidence but cannot establish what prompts were used or whether an AI agent authored a change.

Test counts, CI results, issue status and actions below are **historical reports from the conversations**, not tests rerun or live GitHub status checked while writing this log. Repository-history observations are identified separately. No hidden reasoning, credentials, raw runtime logs or unrelated conversations are included. No separate subagent dialogue was available in the retrieved final-response record, so none is invented.

## Main decisions and corrections

- The app was clarified to be local-only, with three roles, one active user, Gradle and local-file persistence. Early server, database, Maven and installer proposals below are historical suggestions, not the final architecture.
- Shared account/session, incident lifecycle, authorization, repository, audit and presentation contracts preceded responder UI development.
- Login names were explicitly made case-sensitive. Permission changes must take effect without relying on stale UI/session information.
- The user requested sequential implementation of foundational issues, followed by review, explicit commits and push/closure instructions.
- Component acceptance criteria were distinguished from end-to-end integration after an initial mistaken recommendation to hold #37 open until #40.
- Video attachments were initially attempted, then explicitly removed after cross-platform playback problems. The accepted attachment scope became PNG/JPEG images.
- Saved-data incompatibility was diagnosed separately from JavaFX warnings. Old development data was moved to Trash only after explicit user authorization.
- Native Apple Silicon development startup and packaged startup were separate problems; the final packaging work added an ARM JAR alongside the Intel-compatible artifact.
- Requirements and current implementation remain authoritative; this historical log does not introduce new requirements.

## Development visible in Git history without corresponding prompt records

The following supplements the conversations with repository evidence. These rows are **not reconstructed conversations** and make no claim about AI authorship. Commit subjects and merge records establish development milestones, not test results or current remote issue state.

| Area | Repository evidence | Coverage limitation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Initial guidance and scaffold | `d2f7b32` repository skills; `2e4079b` agent guidance; `11c0c68` Incident Desk initialization; `24c1ada` launcher | The initialization/guidance prompts are not in the four retrieved tasks. |
| Shared UI and application services | `56e7488`, `bc89620` UI components; `a4a0955` incident service; `fc672e3` presentation models; `1fdd528` comments; `962db64` shared table | Discussed as dependencies in S4; their originating implementation conversations are unavailable. |
| Persistence, search, SLOs and notifications | `d67132e` recovery-safe local storage; `ebbcd0c` filters; `74ea219` SLO engine; `15d73cd` notification center | Commit evidence only for the originating work. |
| Authentication and account management | `ed1793e` authenticated shell; `765e0ef` registration; `d692866` tombstoned deletion; `9ac7109` password reset | S4 discusses integration and a format mismatch, not all originating prompts. |
| Administrator workflows | `f3bdf3e` dashboard; `015ff43` SLO configuration; `d8f6391` audit log; `4587da8` monitoring; `f27e572` promotion; `4aefc17` category configuration; `3d4b96a` promotion review | User questions and integration effects appear in S4, but the admin development conversations are unavailable. |
| Later administrator completion | `04a8fc7` reassignment/resolution/unassignment, merged via #83; `b236678` operational statistics, merged via #86 | Supersedes the earlier S4 statements that admin incident actions were not yet connected. |
| Original Shadow packaging and ARM merge | `eff155e`, `4635928`, `f6ca960`, `9f268da` packaging changes; `621db48` merges PR #85 | S4 ends before confirming the #85 merge. Local Git history records that later merge; this does not supply its missing conversation. |
| Reporter submission | `e87cf5a` form; `56ed554` tests; `a707d4d`, `b31993c`, `faa42d9` service/results/testing | Reporter implementation prompts are unavailable. |
| Reporter tracking and actions | #94 merge `1b3c1b6` includes history/details, authorized rows, scrolling and tests; #96 merge `6767b11` includes action forms, wiring, tests and docs | Later work is established by commits, not by retrieved prompt history. |
| Guides, website and polish | `d42b9a5` documentation cleanup; `97f8e72` attachment CSS; #92 merge `c8e4d74` guides; #93 merge `35866f4` Jekyll; #95 merge `95e1f9a` site improvements; `66feb22` developer guide expansion | S4 captures the cleanup request; most later documentation and polish prompts are unavailable. |

## Current logging interaction

### S5.01 — 2026-09-29

- **Prompt summary:** Create a Markdown file under `logs` summarizing all development prompts and interactions with AI agents.
- **Attribution follow-up:** The user supplied `lqr1019_prompt_log` as the name for future conversation logs.
- **Agent interaction/outcome:** Used the conversation-logging skill, adapted its transcript format to the requested project-wide summaries, retrieved four project tasks and their complete pagination, checked the archived-task listing, and consulted local Git history. Created this document with 114 historical entries, source IDs, known limitations and a separate commit-evidence supplement.
- **Artifact:** `logs/DevelopmentAIInteractionSummary.md`.
- **Verification:** Entry counts and source-turn coverage are checked against the retrieved records; whitespace and repository scope are checked after writing. Application tests are not rerun for this documentation-only change.
- **Follow-up:** Missing teammate/other-tool conversations would need to be supplied to extend coverage. No commit or push was requested.

## Maintaining this record

For future work, retain the task/date, a short summary of each prompt, the agent’s response or changes, verification outcomes, and unresolved limitations. Do not treat a suggestion as an implemented feature or a local passing test as cross-platform verification.

The conversation-logging skill is intentionally stateless and works best when invoked once near the end of each conversation, before starting a new one. This project-wide summary is a one-time retrospective, not automatic ongoing logging.
